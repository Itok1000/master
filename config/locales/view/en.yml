      ojakhuri1: A typical Georgian meat dish known as “family meal❞
      ojakhuri2: A “Georgian German potato” made with potatoes, onions, pork and herbs such as garlic and pak choi
      ojakhuri3: The crispy potatoes and the crunchy meat are very appetizing and go great with beer!
      badrijani1: one of the most typical appetizers of Georgian cuisine with maximum walnut flavor
      badrijani2: The grilled eggplant is rolled in a paste of walnuts, which makes it look great and is a great choice for small parties.
      badrijani3: If you have a food processor or blender, you can easily make walnut paste.
      sokos_chashushuli1: Georgian sauteed mushrooms with herbs.
      sokos_chashushuli2: Easy and tasty to make with your favorite mushrooms, sauteed with minimal spices at home.
      pkhali1: One of the appetizers with vegetables and walnuts in a paste.
      pkhali2: Basically spinach, beets, etc. are used in most cases, but any vegetable can be used.
      pkhali3: The different colors of the various vegetables allow you to make different shades of pupali.
      pkhali4: This is why in Georgia they are often prepared at banquets.
      pkhali5: One of the appetizers made of a paste of vegetables and walnuts, eaten with bread.
      ostri1: a stew of veal and tomatoes.”
      ostri2: It has a deep spicy flavor because of the abundant use of spices and chili peppers.
      ostri3: In Georgia we eat it with bread, but it also goes well with rice. I recommend it to drinkers because it goes great with alcohol.
      chikirtma1: Chicken and egg soup.”
      chikirtma2: It does not require the spices commonly used in Georgia and can easily be made with powdered bouillon or consommé.

      shkmeruli1: cream stew with chicken and garlic
      shkmeruli2: You can use chopped garlic, but a garlic tube is also delicious.
      shkmeruli3: The authentic version is made with only chicken and garlic, but you can also add potatoes, onions, and sweet potatoes like in a stew.
      shkmeruli4: Chicken and garlic in cream, for those who like garlic.
      chakhohbili1: Chicken stewed with tomatoes.
      chakhohbili2: It looks spicy, but it uses very little spice, and the combination of the non-habitual savory flavor of the chicken and the umami of the tomatoes is sure to please everyone.
      chakhohbili3: The trick is to use chicken with bones or skin.
